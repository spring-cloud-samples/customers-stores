# REST based micro-services sample

- Three Spring Boot based Maven projects that are standalone applications:
  - Stores (MongoDB, exposing a few Starbucks shops across north america, geo-spatial functionality)
  - Customers (JPA)
  - Customers UI (Angular and Spring Boot CLI backend)
- The customers application tries to discover a search-by-location-resource and periodically verifying it's still available (see `StoreIntegration`).
- If the remote system is found the customers app includes a link to let clients follow to the remote system and thus find stores near the customer.
- Hystrix is used to monitor the availability of the remote system, so if it fails to connect 20 times in 5 seconds (by default) the circuit will open and no more attempts will be made until after a timeout.

## Running Instructions
- Before try to run the services, make sure you have Rabbitmq Server and MongoDB running on localhost.
- Make sure you have [Spring Boot for Groovy installed] (https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-gvm-cli-installation)
- Make sure [Spring Cloud CLI is installed] (https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-cli)
- To run the services, just execute "mvn spring-boot:run" in each project subfolder, and "spring run app.groovy" for the UI.

## IDE Support

To use these projects in an IDE you will need the [project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/features/index.html) agent. Full instructions can be found in the Lombok website. The
sign that you need to do this is a lot of compiler errors to do with
missing methods and fields.
